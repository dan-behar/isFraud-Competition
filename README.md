# isFraud-Competition

The goal of the project is to select and create the best prediction algorithm to predict whether a certain transaction is fraudulent or not. This is the first projecto of Machine Learning Models course.

#### Structure of the notebook:
* `Libraries`: Includes a briefly description of where they were used in the process
* `Data Export`: Includes the data export, separation in train-test and exploration
* `Cleaning Pipelines`: Building of the three pipelines that I used
* `Model`: Building of the pipeline where I'm placing my model

#### Description of the repo:
* `FraudModel.pkl`: The file which contains the model created
* `Test.csv`: The dataset without the variable *isFraud*
* `Train.csv`: The dataset with the variable *isFraud*, which is the variable to predict. This dataset was used to create the model
* `script.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all the creation process
* `solutions.csv`: A CSV file with the answers. This competition was submitted in Kaggle and it requiered a specific format to upload the answers
